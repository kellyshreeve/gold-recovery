# Project Overview

This repository hosts an Supervised Machine Learning project building a multi-output regression that minimizes symmetric Mean Absolute Error (sMAPE). This data science project was conducted for Zyfra, a company that develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry, with the purpose of finding which model for gold estraction bet minimizes sMAPE and identifying which factors are unprofitable.
